# MFA Simulator - Unity 

## Intro
Multi Factor Authenticator Simulator is a short game born out of a frustration with multifactor
authentication systems, and a desire to scream that frustration into the void.
The initial vision was intended to be a boring and annoying experience. After adding a couple
small Easter Eggs into the game, I came to the realization that the player enjoying themselves
wouldn't be the worst thing in the world. In the end, I feel I have created a game that makes
something extraordinarily tedious feel fun and humorous. I hope players feel the same way I do
when playing through this game.
Narrative
MFA Simulator is set in a world where all digital activity is logged and authenticated. What
originally seemed a welcome security upgrade was left unchecked for too long, and now
permeates all electronics. Simple things that previously required very little security—phone
updates, logging into your PC—now require further validation with THEM. Failure is not an
option. Our story follows Willow, a 3rd-year university student just trying to get through each
day.
### Gameplay
MFA Simulator is a short game made up of 4 levels. The expected averaged playthrough should
be approximately five minutes.
The controls are as follows:
- Movement: WASD
- Interact: E
- Cancel Interaction: Q
- Mouse Left-Click: Screen Interaction/Progress Dialogue
- Restart Game: [ESC]
### Next Steps
There are more levels planned for this project. Ultimately, I was forced to limit scope
aggressively to ensure all necessary systems were in place and functional by the deadline.
Moving forward, I intend to add back in the cut content, as well as a fresh helping of polish. The
current plan is to continue working on this game for the next few weeks until I feel comfortable
publishing it on itch.io.
### Known Bugs
There are a few bugs discovered either during last-minute testing or through watching other
students play the game in class today. They are documented here in the hopes that those who
play the game are aware and able to navigate around them. None of the bugs are game-breaking,
but they are either confusing or annoying.
#### Visual Issues
● Bug where if the user is in the Email Login screen, the MFA verification prompt may be
visible prior to attempting to login. Codes for this field are only generated when the user
clicks the LOGIN button.
● Player animations are broken
● If the game is restarted without being closed first, there is a change previous elements
that were active previously may flash on the screen briefly.
#### Functional Issues
● Occasionally, the [X] button for closing PC applications breaks. The user can still press Q
to exit the PC, so this is not a major issue.
● Text application on the phone is supposed to scroll automatically when the user receives a
text message. This may lead to confusion if the player is unaware.
